                        <h2>Bulgaria's top caves</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        How many caves there are in Bulgaria is a question with no definitive answer. So far, more than 4,500 have been discovered and mapped. The number is so high because 22 percent of the country is covered with karst, a topography created when water soaks, dissolves and carves sedimentary rocks, mainly limestone, dolomite, and marble. Over millennia, the water shapes the karst into a variety of forms both on the ground and deep below. Caves are some of the most spectacular results of this activity.

                        The most interesting caves in Bulgaria are in the Danubian Plain, where limestone accounts for 75 percent of the bedrock; the Stara Planina, where the deepest and most of the longest caves in the country are to be found; and the the western Rhodope, where marble is common.on.

                        Geologically speaking, caves are young formations: it takes them only a handful of millions of years to be formed. This allows time enough for running and dripping water to create impressive formations like stalagmites, stalactites and stone columns, and for life to adapt to these extreme habitats. Bulgarian caves are home to a range of bats and insects. Some of them also provided early humans with shelter.

                        Less than 60 caves in Bulgaria can be visited by tourists and are staffed by guides to explain the history of the particular site, and to point out its most interesting formations that, after a Rorschach-type of association game played by speleologists, have received names like the Ostrich, the Rocket, the Mushroom, and so on. The Madonna with the Child is probably the most widely distributed "identification" to cave formations in Bulgaria.

                        Here is our selection of the underground experiences for non-spelunkers in Bulgaria. Just remember to wear proper shoes: the constantly high humidity makes the paths and stairs slippery.

                        <h2>The Natural Beauty of Bulgaria</h2>

                    <p>
                        Bulgaria is a popular destination for sea and ski holidays. But the country has also other charming places yet to be discovered. These are the numerous mountains, plains, rivers, villages and many more.

                        Here you can practice many outdoor activities. Among the well developed are trekking and hiking, horse back riding, bird watching, etc. Other practiced activities are: caving, paragliding, mountain-biking, rafting and kayaking, photography tours, botany, etc.

                        The unique geographical location of Bulgaria provides possibilities for all year round adventure activities. There are 4 snowy months, a mild and green spring when many flowers blossom, a hot summer with less rain and a colorful autumn.

                        Bulgaria is one of the few countries with very well preserved nature: 3 National parks, 9 Nature parks an many reserves (2 of them included in the UNESCO list). There are eco-trails, which run through the protected areas and show unique nature wonders.

                        Everyone has a chance to observe the rich flora and fauna in their natural habitat. Especially for the bird watching lovers the country is a must. With more than 400 species of birds, Bulgaria is justifiably known as a bird watcher's paradise. There are over 200 Dalmatian pelicans in the colony at the Srebarna, a UNESCO reserve, which is the best European colony.

                        The chain of the Central Balkan National Park, Pirin and Vitosha mountains National Parks, Rila mountain with many mountain reserves, Rhodope mountain and in the far South east Strandza mountain National Park and the local reserves, with their perfect woods and huge cliffs give great opportunities for raptors. The greatest autumn and winter migration in Europe, when thousands of rare birds fly the so called “Via Pontica” way, can be observed on the Black Seacoast.
